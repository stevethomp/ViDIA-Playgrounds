First steps
1. Have a project
2. Save as workspace, this makes it simpler to give playground access to files
3. File -> New Target -> Cocoa Touch Framework
	- this is needed to get your files in your playgrounds
4. Add files to framework. Add Functions
5. Build

Main
1.
import ImportantWorkProjectPlayground

2.
sayHello()

*** ERROR!

3.
@testable import ImportantWorkProjectPlayground

Home

1.
@testable import ImportantWorkProjectPlayground
import PlaygroundSupport

2. try

let homeVC = HomeViewController()

PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = homeVC.view

*** suddenly an error? nil?

3.
let homeVC = HomeViewController(nibName: nil, bundle: Bundle.projectFramework)

*** works, but no images!

4. Home View Controller
        if let image = UIImage(named: name, in: Bundle(for: type(of: self)), compatibleWith: nil) {

^ I don't like this.
