First steps
Have a project
Save as workspace, this makes it simpler to give playground access to files
File -> New Target -> Cocoa Touch Framework
This is needed to get your files in your playgrounds
Add files to framework. Add Functions
Build

Main.playground
1.
import ImportantWorkProjectPlayground

2.
sayHello()

*** ERROR!

3.
@testable import ImportantWorkProjectPlayground

Formatters
Useful, you can quickly change and test out


View Controller

1.
@testable import ImportantWorkProjectPlayground
import PlaygroundSupport

2. try

let homeVC = HomeViewController()

PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = homeVC.view

*** suddenly an error? nil?

3.
let homeVC = HomeViewController(nibName: nil, bundle: Bundle.projectFramework)

*** works, but no images!

4. Home View Controller
        if let image = UIImage(named: name, in: Bundle(for: type(of: self)), compatibleWith: nil) {

^ Need to do this for any resources loading

Custom
1.
Look at the control, and it’s even animating and receiving events!
What if we want to catch them?

2.
*paste* 
// Get actions
class Receiver {
    @objc func didSelectValue(sender: CustomSegmentControl) {
        print("Tapped segment \(sender.selectedSegmentIndex)")
    }
}
let receiver = Receiver()
custom.addTarget(receiver, action: #selector(Receiver.didSelectValue(sender:)), for: .valueChanged)

3.
Play with animationTime, backgroundColor

4.
I have PlaygroundSupport file, something just for the playground. and you can see I have a convenience view to create a view that’s iOS size. *paste* 8
